The first time execute from cmd: "pip3 install -r install.txt"

For run the program execute: 
"cd nameFolder" 
"python name.py" 
(where "name.py" is the name of the program you want to execute and "nameFolder" is the folder name)

FOR GMAIL:

Allow less secure apps for the gmail account you will be using to send emails. Go to this link https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps. In case you have 2-factor authentication ON for your gmail, go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and create an app password which you will use in the password field of the program.

The first mails will go to the "spam" folder, after marking that mail as "not dangerous" they will arrive normally.
